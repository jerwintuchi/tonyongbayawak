                    The figure above illustrates the time-series data of an AXS&apos; price from January 2021 to October 2022. The forecast of the <span className='text-yellow-500'>tuned model</span> indicates the <span className='text-yellow-300'>95% confidence interval (CI)</span>, signifying uncertainty in the predictions.

                    The resulting normalized RMSE of <strong>0.2495 (approximately 25%)</strong> suggests a reasonable level of accuracy. Since the predicted values closely follow actual price movements and mostly remain within the confidence interval, the model demonstrates reasonable predictive performance.

                    In conclusion, the LSTM model effectively captures trends and provides useful forecasts, with minimal deviation from actual values. This accuracy level supports its reliability for decision-making in time-series forecasting.
